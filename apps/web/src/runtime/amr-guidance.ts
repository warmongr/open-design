 * The console's `billing=<intent>` value that means "open the upgrade surface

 * B's dashboard resolves it against the workspace's own subscription state
 * rather than trusting the caller: a personal owner gets the personal plan
 * modal (the same one the console's 「升级订阅」 hero button opens), a team that
 * never subscribed gets first-checkout, and a subscribed team gets change-plan.
 * That is why this client links one intent for every state instead of guessing
 * a per-state parameter — a wrong guess used to open nothing at all
 * (recvpSQKna0LwR).
 *
 * RESTORED 2026-09-06 (spec T54). origin/main had removed this constant in
 * #7122 (Go-plan launch: "public Pricing is the single comparison surface"),
 * with #7167 following up on Pricing's own copy/layout. Neither removal was a
 * technical constraint — it was an information-architecture choice for that
 * campaign — and it left `amrPlansUrlForProfile` ignoring its `profile`
 * argument, so every non-prod build sent 升级 to PRODUCTION Pricing, whose cards
 * hand plan + interval to production Vela for direct checkout. Product ruled
 * the upgrade entries back onto the profile's own console plan surface.
 *
 * B-side support is not in doubt for THIS value: `billing=plan` is one of the
 * two intents vela's `apps/web/src/routes/team-dashboard.tsx` deep-link effect
 * recognizes today. When its `ownerBillingActionsAvailable` guard is false the
 * dialog simply does not open and the user lands on `/dashboard` — the same
 * page the shipped balance/recharge links already target, so an unsatisfiable
 * intent degrades to today's behavior rather than to an error.

// Primary action offered in the gray error card.

//   - authorize:                   AMR sign-in/authorize flow, then auto-retry on success.
//   - recharge:                    open the AMR console (manual retry afterwards).
//   - upgrade:                     open public Pricing (manual retry afterwards).

//                                  print mode cannot complete Google

//                                  the user finishes OAuth there.
//   - switch-model:                the selected model is gone/disabled, so a
//                                  retry reproduces the same answer. Opens the

//                                  of offering a dead Retry. Design principle
//                                  4: a retry button only appears where a retry
//                                  can actually work.
//   - launch-terminal-switch-model: Antigravity-specific. agy has no
//                                  `--model` flag (upstream #35), so
//                                  switching to a model with available
//                                  quota means opening agy's TUI and
//                                  using its Switch Model picker. The
//                                  daemon spawns the same terminal as
//                                  launch-terminal-auth — the button
//                                  label is the only thing that changes.
//   - open-settings:               S30. The failure is in the user's own machine
//                                  or network path — a corporate proxy, a
//                                  rewritten TLS chain, an unreachable route, a
//                                  host policy, a broken local store. Nothing
//                                  upstream changes on a re-run, and the only
//                                  lever we own is the place those overrides are
//                                  entered: Settings → Local CLI → "Advanced:
//                                  proxy & custom paths", whose `configuredEnv`
//                                  outranks the inherited process env
//                                  (`apps/daemon/src/runtimes/env.ts`). Pairs
//                                  with `secondaryRetry: true` because the
//                                  upstream string this classifies on also
//                                  covers a genuine handshake flake — design
//                                  keeps 〔重试〕 on this card deliberately.
//   - switch-to-cloud:             ladder rung 3. This local path cannot work at
//                                  all (nothing installed, nothing signed in,
//                                  the provider's quota is spent) and none of
//                                  the fixes are in our hands, so the forward
//                                  path is the hosted alternative. The card
//                                  itself draws no button — the AMR switch card
//                                  rendered underneath IS the primary action.
//   - contact-support:             ladder rung 4. Retrying is futile and we have
//                                  no other way out, so the always-present
//                                  secondary 〔Contact support〕 is promoted to
//                                  primary rather than leaving a dead-end card.
// Both terminal-launch actions pair with `secondaryRetry: true` so the

  //
  // All four Runtime State issue codes (`strategies/od-next/protocol.ts:16-19`)
  // share the row: to the user they are one story — the reply came back without
  // the marker — and splitting them would only ask product for four wordings of
  // the same sentence.
  // The turn ran to the end and produced no openable file.
  //
  // Ladder rung 2. Distinct from the four Runtime State codes on purpose: to
  // the user those say "your reply went missing", and this one says "nothing
  // came out this round" — a different sentence, a different expectation, and
  // the only one of the two that is true when the project is empty. Since the

  // (`reattributeUndeclaredTurn`), it is the code a real empty-handed turn
  // lands on whether or not the agent wrote its machine block.
  //

  // nothing, and a re-run is exactly the thing that can write it. A turn whose

  // Retry still earns its place, for a different reason than rung 2's usual

  //
  // They were structurally unreachable, for the same reason the
  // `model_unavailable` family above was: the ONE code web has an S10 card for
  // is `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE`, and the ACP/JSON-RPC path never emits it. That

  // `AGENT_EXECUTION_FAILED` and — unlike the json-event-stream and Claude
  // paths in `server.ts`, which both run `classifyAgentServiceFailure` — never
  // upgrades the code from the text. So an AMR/vela run whose provider replied
  // 「Our servers are currently overloaded」 arrives at this table carrying the
  // opaque code plus one of these two details, and nothing claimed it.
  //
  // What that cost the user is not a missing sentence. The generic card's

  //
  // Same card as `fatal_rpc_error` above, deliberately: one scenario, one
  // story, and the copy + its 19 locales already exist. `daemonNamedTheFailure`

  // do not READ that verdict: the card is right for an older daemon that ships
  // the detail without it, which is the state the wire is actually in today.
  //
  // Resolved HERE and not in `DETAIL_FAILURE_UI` for three reasons:
  //   1. The family's code-keyed row already resolves at this precedence, above
  //      every agent branch. Splitting one card across two layers would make
  //      "may an agent branch pre-empt this?" depend on nothing more than
  //      whether the daemon happened to have a structured error code.
  //   2. The difference is reachable, not theoretical. The classifier's
  //      RATE_LIMITED branch sits BELOW its model branch, so `RATE_LIMITED` +
  //      `model_not_supported` is a real pair — and from `DETAIL_FAILURE_UI`
  //      the Antigravity `RATE_LIMITED` branch would claim it first and title a
  //      model-unavailability 「速率受限」.
  //   3. `DETAIL_FAILURE_UI` is scoped to OVERRIDING a code mapping that is
  //      wrong or too vague. These override nothing — `AGENT_EXECUTION_FAILED`
  //      has no row in any table.
  //
  // ⚠️ `provider_routing_error` is deliberately NOT here even though
  // `modelUnavailableDetail()` also emits it: `upstreamDetail()` emits the SAME
  // string for `upstream_unavailable` / `retryable: true` / `'retry'`, and this
  // module receives the detail without the category, so one row would mis-card
  // the upstream half. It needs `failureCategory` on the wire first.
  //
  // ⚠️ 待拍板 — `local_model_not_loaded` is the one member whose copy fits
  // loosely. The daemon prescribes `switch_model` for it like the rest, and the
  // family card is the honest place for it (the selected model genuinely cannot
  // serve the run), but its literal fix is "load a model in LM Studio", not
  // "pick another model here". Routing is right; the sentence may want its own
