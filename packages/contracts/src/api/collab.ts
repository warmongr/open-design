/**
 * The fields that name WHO a workspace context belongs to — and nothing else.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The product resolves the same person's workspace context from two sources,
 * and they legitimately disagree:
 *
 * - The SHELL (`GET /api/workspace/context`, the account membership
 *   directory) reports the member's REAL `role`.
 * - The PROJECT scope fast path (`GET /api/projects/:id/workspace-scope` →
 *   `resolveLocalProjectWorkspaceScope` in apps/daemon) resolves *without
 *   consulting the membership directory* — that is its stated contract and the
 *   reason the read-only decision can paint on the first frame — so it fills
 *   `role` with a least-privilege `member` placeholder. That placeholder is
 *   load-bearing: it is how "creator may write / non-creator is read-only" is
 *   implemented (see `workspaceResourceAccess` in
 *   apps/daemon/src/collab/workspace-resource-mutation.ts). It must not be
 *   "fixed", and it must not be made to wait on the network.
 *
 * Everything else the two sources publish for one member of one workspace is
 * byte-identical: `canShareProjects` / `canWriteSyncedFiles` derive from
 * `memberStatus` + `lifecycleState` only (see {@link buildWorkspacePermissions}),
 * never from `role`. So `role` is the ONLY field that can differ — which is why
 * a naive "are these the same context" comparison silently works for a plain
 * member and silently fails for an owner or an admin.
 *
 * That has produced the same defect seven times so far, always written as an
 * ad-hoc field-by-field or cache-key comparison at the call site:
 *
 *  1. A balance dialog that told the team owner to "ask your team owner"
 *     (§6.V / OPEND-2720) — fixed by {@link workspaceBillingAuthorityContext}.
 *  2. A plan-gated model whose "upgrade to use this" tooltip did nothing when
 *     clicked, on team AND personal workspaces (`AvatarMenu`).
 *  3. "项目不存在" on a team owner's own project, opened from its directory card
 *     (`bootstrapProjectRoute`).
 *  4. The progressive first-open lane dead for every owner/admin, silently
 *     falling back to full materialization (`bootstrapFirstOpenTeamProjectRoute`).
 *  5. A home project grid that never went stale after the owner shared or
 *     unshared, so Back showed the pre-share state (`project-display-cache`).
 *  6. Every project open by an owner/admin discarding the route bootstrap's
 *     pre-fetched scope and refetching it (`useProjectWorkspaceScope`).
 *  7. `App.handleProjectChange`'s route-snapshot match, which compares the
 *     route snapshot's scope-derived context against the directory-derived
 *     project context — still open at the time of writing.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * Asking **"is this the same person in the same workspace?"** goes through this
 * helper — never through a cache key, never through a hand-rolled field
 * comparison. `role` is authorization state, not identity, and the answer to
 * "who is this" may not depend on it.
 *
 * `memberStatus` and `lifecycleState` are excluded for a related reason: the two
 * sources describe DIFFERENT OBJECTS' state (the project's own row versus the
 * workspace's directory entry — a frozen project reads back `locked` while its
 * workspace is `active`). They are state of an identity, not the identity, and
 * every consumer that cares about them still reads them from whichever context
 * is authoritative for its own question.
 *
 * Using `role` to decide **whether this person may change this thing** remains
 * correct and is untouched by this helper — that is what
 * `workspaceResourceAccess`, the `x-od-workspace-role` request header, and the
 * daemon's mutation gate do.

 * without it), so surfacing an external billing action to a team member
 * without it can only produce a button that fails on arrival. That gate is
 * correct and this predicate keeps it exactly as strict.
 *
 * A PERSONAL workspace has no second member. The wallet is the signed-in

 * This is the ONE predicate every billing entrance must agree on. The audience

 * (`workspaceUpgradeUrl`) both read it here, because a user who is routed to
 * the upgrade dialog and a user who is handed an upgrade link have to be the
 * same user. Deriving it twice is how a dialog grows a body with no way out.

/**
 * The one context a billing entrance may be resolved from, for a run that a
 * specific project's workspace pays for.
 *
 * Two questions get confused here, and they have different authorities.
 *
 * WHICH WORKSPACE PAYS is the project's resolved scope, and only the project's
 * resolved scope. A settled unavailable/forbidden scope produces no context at
 * all, and that absence must stay an absence: substituting whichever workspace
 * the navigation rail happens to be in is how a Team project's empty wallet
 * ends up asking about the viewer's Personal one. So `scoped` is passed through
 * untouched in its identity — there is no input to this function that can make
 * the result name a different `workspaceId`, `workspaceType`, or
 * `workspaceMemberId` than `scoped` did, and a null `scoped` stays null.
 *
 * WHO IS ASKING the project scope cannot answer. `resolveLocalProjectWorkspaceScope`
 * (apps/daemon) resolves a project's scope *without consulting the membership
 * directory* — that is its stated contract and the reason it is fast and
 * local — so it fills `role` with a least-privilege `member` placeholder. That
 * placeholder is load-bearing for writes: the daemon's resource gate derives
 * `privileged` from the role the project request asserts, and a placeholder
 * that said `owner` would let a workspace owner write every project in the
 * workspace, including ones they did not create. It must not be "fixed".
 *
 * What it must not do is answer a MONEY question. Asked whether the viewer may
 * reach a billing entrance, the placeholder demotes a workspace owner to a
 * member and deletes their own way to pay — the dialog becomes "ask your team
 * owner" for the team owner themselves (§6.V / OPEND-2720, reproduced on a
 * real runtime 2026-09-07).
 *
 * So this adopts exactly one thing — the membership role — and only from an
 * authoritative context (`GET /api/workspace/context`) that names the very same
 * workspace AND the very same member. Permissions are re-derived through
 * {@link buildWorkspacePermissions} using the SCOPE's own lifecycle and member
 * status, because those describe this project's state (a frozen project reads
 * back `locked`) rather than the directory's view of the workspace. A frozen
 * project therefore stays unwritable no matter whose role is adopted.
 *
 * Everything else — a mismatch of any identity field, an absent authority —
 * keeps the fail-closed scope exactly as it is.
 *
 * The AUTHORITY's own `memberStatus` is deliberately not consulted (product
 * ruling 2026-09-07). It could only ever change the outcome for the pairing
 * "the directory reports this member removed, yet the project's scope still
 * resolves for them", and the product ships no entrance that removes a member,
 * so that pairing has no way to occur. Adding the branch anyway would only buy
 * an unreachable one: nothing this function returns is an authorization. The
 * permission bits are still re-derived from the SCOPE's own `memberStatus`
