  // An ACP agent CLI answered `initialize` and then refused to open a session

  // shape Kimi Code 0.37.x / 0.38.0 fails in. Nothing streamed, so the run
  // produced nothing, and re-running the identical request against the
  // identical build only reproduces it. The one variable left is the installed
  // CLI build, so clients render "this version can't start a session — change
  // it, then retry" from THIS code rather than from any sentence the daemon
  // writes: a daemon-authored string never passes through the client's i18n.
  // The agent's own JSON-RPC line stays in the error `message` (it is both the
  // classifier's input and the text the error card shows under details), and
  // `details` carries the runtime identity the localized copy interpolates:
  // `{ kind: 'agent_cli', action: 'update_cli', agent? }`.
  // A handshake failure that DOES name its cause (signed out, throttled, no
  // credit, upstream 5xx) keeps that cause's own code instead.

  // The agent emitted a fabricated Markdown role marker
  // (`## user` / `## assistant` / `## system`) inside its own response.
  // The chat host parses those lowercase lines as real turn
  // boundaries, so an emission is a prompt-injection attempt the model
  // committed against itself (issue #3247; same class as #2102 /
  // #2464). The daemon detects the marker in the stream, truncates
  // emission at that point, and terminates the agent subprocess
  // (SIGTERM with SIGKILL fallback) so no further tokens or
  // `tool_use` blocks reach the dispatcher. Emitted by
  // `server.ts::abortForRoleMarker` alongside the existing
  // `fabricated_role_marker` warning event. Retryable.
  'ROLE_MARKER_HALLUCINATION',
  // The agent got stuck repeating failing tool calls (e.g. re-running the same
  // Edit that errors "string not found", or the same shell command that keeps
  // exiting non-zero) without making progress. The daemon's tool-loop guard
  // (`tool-loop-guard.ts`) counts consecutive failures and repeats of the same
  // failing action. Only emitted when OD_TOOL_LOOP_GUARD=halt is enabled: at
  // the hard ceiling the guard terminates the run so the agent cannot grind
  // through dozens more identical attempts. The default mode is `warn`, which
  // only surfaces a heads-up `tool_loop` event and never emits this error. The
  // caller should re-check the actual target (the file, the element, the
  // command) before retrying rather than resubmitting the same turn.

  // (issue #2467 review on PR #2579). The bug is in the source file;
  // the operator cannot recover the run, the daemon must abort it and
  // surface the def-correctness error so it shows up in dev rather
  // than silently disabling the agent-specific watchdog.

  // A design-system enrichment ("AI Optimize") run was requested while the

  // a hidden seeded prompt that refines the registered design system in
  // place, so a second concurrent pass bills twice and races on the same
  // files (2026-07-28: one double-triggered affordance billed two runs). The
  // daemon rejects the newcomer with HTTP 409 and names the run that already
  // owns the conversation in `details` (`DesignSystemEnrichmentInProgressDetails`)

  // while that run is active; ordinary chat turns are never gated by this.

  // seeding) with one request-wide deadline. When the deadline passes the
  // daemon answers HTTP 504 with this code and commits nothing, so a client
  // that already entered an optimistic project surface can roll back to its
  // composer instead of waiting on a stalled create. Retryable: the same
  // client-minted project id may be resubmitted.
